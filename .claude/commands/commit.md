# Commit Command

Commit changes

## Guidelines for Automatic Commit Splitting
- Split commits by feature, component, or concern
- Keep related file changes together in the same commit
- Separate refactoring from feature additions
- Ensure each commit can be understood independently
- Multiple unrelated changes should be split into separate commits
