===== CHUNK 1 =====
# Test Documentation

This is a sample markdown document for testing the LineChunker functionality.

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a realistic test fixture for chunking markdown content. It includes various markdown elements like headers, paragraphs, lists, and code blocks.

## Features

===== CHUNK 2 =====
### Basic Text Processing

The chunker should handle regular paragraphs effectively. This includes:

- Short sentences
- Medium-length paragraphs with multiple sentences that explain concepts in detail
- Long paragraphs that might need to be split across chunks

### Code Blocks

===== CHUNK 3 =====
Here's an example of TypeScript code:

```typescript
interface ChunkerOptions {
  maxLines: number;
  overlap: number;
  maxChars: number;
}

class Chunker {
===== CHUNK 4 =====
  constructor(private options: ChunkerOptions) {}
  
  chunk(text: string): string[] {
    // Implementation details
    return [];
  }
}
```

### Lists and Enumerations
===== CHUNK 5 =====

1. **Ordered lists** with various items
2. **Nested content** that includes:
   - Sub-items with details
   - Multiple levels of nesting
   - Different formatting styles
3. **Mixed content** combining text and code

### Tables

===== CHUNK 6 =====
| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Line-based chunking | Split by line count | ✓ |
| Character limit | Enforce max chars | ✓ |
| Overlap support | Configurable overlap | ✓ |

## Advanced Usage

### Configuration Examples

===== CHUNK 7 =====
The chunker can be configured in various ways:

```typescript
// Default configuration
const chunker1 = new LineChunker();

// Custom line limit
const chunker2 = new LineChunker({
  maxLines: 50,
  overlap: 10
===== CHUNK 8 =====
});

// Character-based limits
const chunker3 = new LineChunker({
  maxLines: 100,
  maxChars: 1000,
  overlap: 20
});
```

===== CHUNK 9 =====
### Best Practices

When using the chunker, consider these guidelines:

1. **Choose appropriate chunk sizes** based on your use case
2. **Set overlap** to maintain context between chunks
3. **Monitor performance** with large documents
4. **Test edge cases** thoroughly

## Conclusion
===== CHUNK 10 =====

This test document covers various markdown elements and should provide good coverage for testing the chunking algorithm. The chunker should handle all these elements gracefully while respecting the configured limits.
