# Continuity ledger (per-branch)

## Human intent (must not be overwritten)

- Add API keys management page to studio app at `/settings/team/api-keys`
- Display API keys in a table format with dummy data
- Add API keys link to sidebar navigation

## Goal (incl. success criteria)

- Create API keys page at `apps/studio.giselles.ai/app/(main)/settings/team/api-keys/page.tsx`
- Display table with columns: NAME, STATUS, SECRET KEY, CREATED, LAST USED, CREATED BY
- Add "Create new secret key" button
- Add API keys link to Manage section in sidebar
- Use dummy data matching the provided image (3 API keys)
- Follow workspaces page layout pattern

## Constraints/Assumptions

- Permission column excluded as requested
- Edit/delete functionality are placeholders (console.log) for now
- API will be implemented separately later
- Card component from `apps/studio.giselles.ai/app/(main)/settings/components/` should not be used
- Single page.tsx file (no separate layout.tsx)

## Key decisions

- Use `PageHeading` with glow effect for title
- Use `GlassButton` for create button
- Use `Table` components from `@giselle-internal/ui/table`
- Follow workspaces page layout pattern: `px-[40px] py-[24px] flex-1 max-w-[1200px] mx-auto w-full`
- Status badge uses green background (`bg-green-500/20 text-green-400`)
- Date formatting: `toLocaleDateString("en-US", { month: "short", day: "numeric", year: "numeric" })`

## State

- API keys page created at `apps/studio.giselles.ai/app/(main)/settings/team/api-keys/page.tsx`
- Sidebar updated with API keys link in Manage section (`/settings/team/api-keys`)
- Page follows workspaces layout pattern
- Dummy data includes 3 API keys: local-dev-2, local-developing, Developing
- Old route `/manage/api-keys` now redirects to `/settings/team/api-keys`

## Done

- Created API keys page with PageHeading, description text, create button, and table
- Added API keys link to sidebar Manage section (`/settings/team/api-keys`)
- Implemented table with all required columns (NAME, STATUS, SECRET KEY, CREATED, LAST USED, CREATED BY)
- Added edit/delete icons with placeholder handlers
- Adjusted layout to match workspaces page pattern (outer container with padding and max-width)
- Formatted code with Biome
- Removed unused Key icon import
- Moved the route from `/manage/api-keys` to `/settings/team/api-keys` and added a redirect for backward compatibility

## Now
