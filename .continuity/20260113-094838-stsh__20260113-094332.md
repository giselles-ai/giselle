# Continuity ledger (per-branch)

## Human intent (must not be overwritten)

<!--
Write 1–5 bullets capturing the human goal and motivation.
This section is intentionally stable: do not overwrite it when updating the ledger.
-->

- Translate `docs/plan/api-sdk.md` into English so the SDK docs are accessible to non-Japanese readers.

## Goal (incl. success criteria)

- `docs/plan/api-sdk.md` is fully in English, while preserving the code example and overall structure.

## Constraints/Assumptions

- Keep changes minimal and obvious (docs-only).
- Preserve the existing TypeScript code block as-is.

## Key decisions

- Translate only the Japanese prose; keep product/package names and code unchanged.

## State

- `docs/plan/api-sdk.md` contained a short Japanese intro sentence and a TypeScript example, followed by an empty “Tasks” section.

## Done

- Translated the introduction sentence to English.
- Appended a checked, “bureaucratic” Tasks checklist based on `CONTINUITY.md` and prior `.continuity/*` ledgers (SDK work already completed).

## Now

- Ensure this per-branch ledger reflects the additional Tasks-section update.

## Next

- Add SDK file upload support (SDK feature; server/API support may be required).
- Add file input support to `@giselles-ai/sdk` `runAndWait` via **either** `fileId` (from upload) **or** base64 payload (with size limit).
- In `studio.giselles.ai/tasks`, make it clear when a task execution originated from the public API (SDK).

## Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed)

- None.

## Working set (files/ids/commands)

- `docs/plan/api-sdk.md`
- `.continuity/20260113-094838-stsh__20260113-094332.md`
