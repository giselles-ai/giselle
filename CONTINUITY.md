- Goal (incl. success criteria): Complete the AGENTS.md documentation by replacing TBD sections with accurate English descriptions of Architecture, Development Workflow, and Conventions. (Done)
- Constraints/Assumptions: The project is a monorepo with 10k+ commits. Existing code and configs are the source of truth.
- Key decisions: Analyzed codebase structure, pnpm workspace, and naming/style guides to populate documentation.
- State: Documentation updated.
- Done:
  - Created CONTINUITY.md.
  - Analyzed architecture (monorepo, apps, packages).
  - Analyzed workflow (pnpm commands, contribution guide).
  - Analyzed conventions (naming, biome, error handling).
  - Updated AGENTS.md with gathered information.
- Now: Task complete.
- Next:
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Working set (files/ids/commands): AGENTS.md, CONTINUITY.md
