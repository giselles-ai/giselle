# Continuity Ledger

## Goal

## Constraints/Assumptions
- Adhere to `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.
- Use English for all code and documentation unless strictly required otherwise.
- Maintain the "Less is more" philosophy.

## Key decisions
- Initialized `CONTINUITY.md` to track session state.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with architectural insights from codebase exploration.

## State
- Repository is a large monorepo (>10k commits) using pnpm and turbo.
- Architecture involves `apps` (playground, studio) and `packages` (giselle, protocol, etc.).

## Done
- Explored workspace structure.
- Analyzed `package.json`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- Inspected `apps/` and `packages/` contents.
- Verified naming conventions and code style.
- Checked error handling patterns.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with gathered information.
- Added "Development Philosophy" section from `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md`.
- Added "Update CONTINUITY.md" to "After Every Code Change" section in `AGENTS.md`.

## Now
- Updated `CONTINUITY.md` after `AGENTS.md` change.

## Next
- Await further instructions.

## Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed)
- None at the moment.

## Working set (files/ids/commands)
- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTINUITY.md`
